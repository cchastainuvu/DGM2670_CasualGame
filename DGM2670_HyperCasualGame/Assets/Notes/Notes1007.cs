/*Dependency is a script relying on another object or script's information, like the letter
 relying on the ring to provide information about its color to apply a change to the sprite.
 
 "The letter will not work without a ring."
 
 Avoid programming dependencies or you will end up with too many scripts to manage.*/

/*Anything being called by a trigger, we will call Invoke(), same for any called by Events.*/
